# YARWiki
Yes, Yet Another Ruby-based Wiki. I love wikis. And I have been using them for a number of years. And through wikis I met ruby and ruby-on-rails, so this association is pretty natural to me.

So, when I decided I needed to improve my ruby-on-rails skills, one thing became obvious to me: why not writing a wiki from scratch in ruby(-on-rails)?

**Note:** I've got a similar effort running for a long time, but using **go** [here](https://github.com/jbonnet/gwiki).
