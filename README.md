# YARWiki
Yes, Yet Another Ruby-based Wiki. I love wikis. And I have been using them for a number of years. And through wikis I met ruby and ruby-on-rails, so this association is pretty natural to me.

So, when I decided I needed a more efficient wiki and improve my ruby-on-rails skills (specially at the frontend, where ruby-on-rails has evolved quite rapidly), one thing became obvious to me: why not writing a wiki from scratch in ruby(-on-rails)?

**Note:** I've got a similar effort running for a long time, but using **go** [here](https://github.com/jbonnet/gwiki).

## Features
As this wiki user, I want to be able to:

1. Quickly starting taking notes, without a new page having to be sent from the server;
2. Quickly taking a look at the most recent notes taken;
3. Have a powerfull search feature;
